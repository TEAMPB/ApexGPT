# ApexGPT

## Description

ApexGPT is a prototype of a chat based application through which users are supposed to be able to edit Oracle APEX low-code applications using natural language. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo (1106 preview) Large Language Model (LLM) as the basis of its language understanding and reasoning ability.

This repository contains the source code of the project as created for a Thesis at Paderborn University.

## Installation

This prototype needs to be run in an Oracle APEX instance inside an Oracle database. Instructions on how to install this prototype are contained in the PDF under docs/installation.pdf. This document is the appendix of the mentioned thesis.
